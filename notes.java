plant gains energy from sunlight = depend on intensity of sunlight [0,1]
traits of plant
  energy
  leaf area - determine frac of energy spent on maintenance
  height - stem
  seed - frac of energy spent on releasing seeds

if threshold energy for seed fulfilled then seed sent distance based on area of leaf and height

species stay where they are
go to nearest food every day
energy used to get to food - distance * size^3 + laziness
- if not enough energy to get even a single piece of food, die
if arrive at same food as another creature (no need at same time), eaten by larger creature
if eat food, gain energy e

two different species (each species with its own distinct traits) coexisting - see which one prevails?
